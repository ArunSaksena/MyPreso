## Introducing:  A New Application that helps you understand the MPG of the Car of your Dreams!

1. Fuel economy of vehicles has always been one of the top factors that influence Auto
purchase decisions

2. We are now entering an era where Consumers can customize, among other things, the size
and power of the car of their dreams

3. Consumers, however, have no easy way to estimate the fuel efficiency (in MPG) of their
unique creations

4. Introducing an App that makes it easy for Consumers to estimate MPG based on a few simple inputs

## The Miles per Gallon (MPG) of a Car depends upon Horse Power and Weight

Choose your desired car carefully!  Heavier cars with more power deliver less MPG
