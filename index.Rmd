## Introducing:  A New Application that helps you understand the MPG of the Car of your Dreams!

1. Fuel economy of vehicles has always been one of the top factors that influence Auto
purchase decisions

2. We are now entering an era where Consumers can customize, among other things, the size
and power of the car of their dreams

3. Consumers, however, have no easy way to estimate the fuel efficiency (in MPG) of their
unique creations

4. Introducing an App that makes it easy for Consumers to estimate MPG based on a few simple inputs

## The Miles per Gallon (MPG) of a Car depends upon Horse Power and Weight

Choose your desired car carefully!  Heavier cars with more power deliver less MPG

```{r, qplot, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=13, fig.height=6}

library(shiny)
library(ggplot2)
library(gridExtra)
library(datasets)
data(mtcars)

plot1 <- qplot(hp, mpg, data = mtcars, main = "MPG vs HP", xlab = "Horse Power of car", ylab = "MPG") + geom_smooth()
plot2 <- qplot(wt, mpg, data = mtcars, main = "MPG vs Weight", xlab = "Weight of car", ylab = "MPG") + geom_smooth()

grid.arrange(plot1, plot2, ncol=2)

```

## OK... Lets Start using the App!

1. Please click on the link below which will take you to the Interactive App
2. The instructions for using the App are self-evident

## I hope you were able to use my App.  Here is information on the mtcars dataset that I used to create my prediction model

#### There were `r length(rownames(mtcars))` cars whose data is provided in the mtcars dataset.    


#### These cars are: 

`r rownames(mtcars)`

#### The information in the mtcars dataset includes:  

`r colnames(mtcars)`
